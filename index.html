	<div class="col-sm-6 intro-text">
		<p>During the 49ers' 2016 final preseason game, quarterback Colin Kaepernick knelt for the national anthem instead of taking a seat on the bench in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in America. He explained,</p>
          <p>"I am not going to show pride in flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."</p>
          <p>Kaepernick's actions soon became a polarizing issue amongst the American public, often along racial divides, and sparked a wave of similar protests among atheletes that continues today.</p>
          <p>The hashtag "#VeteransForKaepernick" was created. He was voted the most disliked member of the NFL in a 2016 poll. Several public figures condemned his actions and fans boycotted the NFL, leading to a drop in ratings. He also received death threats.</p>
